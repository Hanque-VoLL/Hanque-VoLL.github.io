      <h3 style="color: rgb(228, 18, 18);"><b>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</b></h3>
      <p style="border: 1px solid black">My first initial point of attention was directed towards how the website interacted with my mouse movement as it was responsive to every movement of the mouse. Everytime I interacted with my mouse, it would affect what would be happening on the screen. For example: when you first load onto the ‘Liquid Entropy’ page, every time you move your mouse the screen would react as if you’re standing above water and touching it as it creates a small shockwave of motion directing away from where you touch it. It reminded me of the scene from The Matrix where Neo touches the mirror to which it reacts like it’s made of liquid instead of solid glass.

        <h3 style="color: rgb(228, 18, 18);"><b>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions</b></h3>
          <h4>&#8226; Tracks movement of mouse</h4>
          <h4>&bull; Control Panel</h4>
          <h4>&#8226; Tab at top of screen that lead to other experiences</h4>
          <h4>&bull; Music playing</h4></p>
          <h4>&bull; Mute button + sound controller</h4></p>
          <h4>&bull; Skip music button</h4></p>
          <h4>&bull; 3D environment</h4></p>
          <h4>&bull; Sound effects</h4></p>
          <h4>&bull; Website name at top left</h4></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(228, 18, 18);"><b>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</b></h3>
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">I spent most of my time on the experience called ‘First Opus’ as I was interested in how the 3D environment surrounded the interactive glass panel floating in space. Every other experience felt disorienting and very in my face confronting whereas the ‘First Opus’ experience is the opposite. Its canyon 3D environment is peaceful scenery that allows me to zoom in and out on the interactive subject. It’s similar to the ‘Liquid Entropy’ experience, however the ability to zoom in and out makes it easier to interact with as it’s not quite literally in your face and disorienting. </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(228, 18, 18);"><b>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</b></h3>
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">The most common action within my two minute interaction was definitely the tab at the top of the screen as I wanted to see as many different experiences as possible before the timer ended. I spent around 20 seconds on each experience, to get the gist of its purpose and content then clicked onto the next one. The second action that was most common was the control panel that some experiences had integrated as to change the different reactions it would have with my mouse movements.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(228, 18, 18);"><b>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</b></h3>
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">It was a very interesting interactive experience and I found it great that each experience was either a 3D environment or an interactive experience with your mouse (or both). I could see the primary goal was definitely something on the lines of an online art gallery or portfolio as you could navigate into different environments and experiences with a tab feature. It definitely could be the next step for future development of online art gallery experiences for the next generation of artists that use technology to create pieces of artworks.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(228, 18, 18);"><b>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</b></h3>
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">I believe it’s pretty straightforward with how it communicates its primary purpose, it’s not that complicated to use and doesn’t take too much time to figure out how to navigate. I can see that it’s the foundation of something that can be built to become a very big idea to display pieces of work that people have created, i.e,. a virtual museum.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(228, 18, 18);"><b>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</b></h3>
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">Depending on how many artworks there are and the complexity of each one can definitely change the duration of how long it is used for and how many times you interact with it. It’s the same reason why people visit museums or art galleries as they want to see pieces of history and their complexity. They want to view how something so complex was created using the tools at their disposal. It’s the reason why James Cameron’s Avatar is the highest grossing film of all time, it’s because at the time of its release there was nothing ever like it before and even time has gone on it’s interesting to go back and see how we’ve evolved since then. Also to wonder how they were able to create something so advanced for the time period they were in.</p>

      <li>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(228, 18, 18);"><b>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</b></h3>
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">It definitely lays down the groundwork for future development in online art galleries or museums as now anyone can share their artworks online. More importantly art experiences where it can take the viewer on a journey that they can control themselves as they are given the tools to play with. Similar reasons why Minecraft is such a popular game, as it gives people the opportunity to experience how they want to with the tools they are given by the creators as not everyone will play the same way. It’s the same with the website as you are given tools for an experience and it’s up to you how you will shape your own experience with what you are given.</p>

        <h3 style="color: rgb(228, 18, 18);"><b>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</b></h3>        
          <h4>&#8226; Art Galleries</h4>
          <h4>&bull; Museums</h4>
          <h4>&#8226; YouTube</h4>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(228, 18, 18);"><b>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</b></h3>
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">You’re supposed to consume what is displayed and you’re allowed to come up with your own interpretations. You can create your own work that can be shared with others to either give them an experience, a different perspective or both. These are platforms for both sides of the same coin where you can consume and share.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(228, 18, 18);"><b>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</b></h3>
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">It depends on a culmination of variables, the main one being how the artist wants their audience to feel and the message they’re trying to convey. Other variables consist of if these messages conflict with the audience’s already pre-existing point of view or the website’s UI and its navigation experience. If a website’s UI isn’t good or doesn’t have a good feel to it then it could make you frustrated and not enjoy using it even though you may be interested in the content it has.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(228, 18, 18);"><b>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</b></h3>
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">I think the most frustrating element is something that doesn’t exist with the experience, which is something that allows the user to change the perspective using the control panel and that’s something to compare the results of the default to the final result. I just found it quite annoying that I wasn’t able to see the change from what it was to what it turned into and it would’ve been interesting to see that. Another thing with the UI is the volume controls as I wish it didn’t max out the volume from the start of the experience because it felt very in your face and even if it wasn’t loud enough you can easily change that with increasing the volume to an acceptable level that you’re comfortable with.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(228, 18, 18);"><b>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</b></h3>
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">The most satisfying element was definitely the tabs up the top to navigate to another experience as I felt it was well put together and easy to understand/use. Another thing was the control panel which gave you the tools needed to morph your experience in a way that you wanted to. Of course, it’s very limited to what you can do with the control panel however it’s an interesting element that could definitely be improved on in the future for much bigger experiences.</p>
