            <h3>Design Decisions:</h3>

            <p>   My specific design choices were inspired from fandom websites and my design itself is inspired by the anime/manga known as ‘One Piece’. Originally I was going to plan my design around One Piece, however that poses a couple copyright issues that I would rather avoid as it would take up a lot of time and effort. So to start off, I implemented the parallax effect for the front page and allowed the user to scroll down to 10 different clickable buttons with a different word for each. The 10 different words respond to the 10 different crew members of the fictional crew created by Chat GPT as I asked it to create 10 members of a pirate crew that are similar to the One Piece strawhat crew. Each different text button has an individual background that relates to the character, for example: The Swordsman has the background of a sword. When scrolling, you would notice that the background and buttons aren’t static and move like a page wipe. That is the parallax effect which makes the front page look more engaging for the users instead of it being flat and stagnant. When clicking on one of the buttons, it will bring you to the page of that particular character. 

                On this page, there will be a biography about the character and who they are and some additional facts about them. All the information was created by Chat GPT and incorporated into the website. I also implemented the other crew members as clickable links so that the user is able to go from character to character without having to go back to the front page again.

                <p>Below the title of the page, there are three individual tabs, one is for a video which is supposed to be a quick video of the character (such as a clip from the show/anime they are from). This would’ve been a clip from One Piece but as I previously mentioned, licensing issues prevent me from doing so. So instead, I used the video clip from experiment 4 just as a placeholder. The third and final tab is for this writing as I need to add this to the website somehow so I thought that would be an appropriate way of doing it.

                    For the character page, I wanted to condense the information to the middle of the screen as it looks more aesthetically pleasing and typically fandoms don't utilize all of the screen and just mostly use the middle. The intention for the start page was so that the user can easily just scroll down and choose one character so that they can learn more about them. I wanted it to be easy and simple to navigate and use.
