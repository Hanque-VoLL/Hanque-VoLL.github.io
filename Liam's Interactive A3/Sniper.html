    <h2>Favourite Weapons</h2>

      <li><b>Lightning-Strike Rifle:
    </b>
    The Lightning-Strike Rifle is Sharpshot's go-to weapon, a high-precision sniper rifle designed for long-range engagements. It boasts exceptional accuracy, enhanced by advanced targeting systems and stabilizers. Equipped with an electrically charged barrel, each shot carries the potential to release a surge of electrical energy, immobilizing targets and delivering devastating shock damage.

        <li> -</li>
        <li><b>Shadow's Whisper Bow:
        </b>
        For close to mid-range combat, Sharpshot favors the Shadow's Whisper Bow. This sleek and silent weapon allows for swift and precise shots, ideal for stealthy operations. The bow is crafted from special materials that absorb sound, making it nearly undetectable when fired. Its arrows are tipped with specially designed heads that maximize penetration and inflict severe damage on impact.

          <li><b>Serpent's Fang Dagger:
        </b>
        In situations that call for close-quarters combat or when stealth is paramount, Sharpshot relies on the Serpent's Fang Dagger. This elegant yet deadly weapon is forged from a rare and resilient metal, making it lightweight and versatile. The blade itself is intricately etched with serpentine patterns, hinting at its poison-infused properties. Each strike from the Serpent's Fang Dagger delivers a dose of potent venom that weakens adversaries and induces paralysis.
