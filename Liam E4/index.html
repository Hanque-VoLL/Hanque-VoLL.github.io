        <!-- I implemented a playback button feature as that is usually what is provided to the user when traversing 
          through a website that has some sort of media playback feature. In this HTML document, I've linked each script 
          from the JS sheet to a button with each button having a different value of speed. One of course is the normal 
          1x playback speed then we have 0.5x which is to slow the video down and finally the 2x just in case the user 
          wants to speed the video up  -->
